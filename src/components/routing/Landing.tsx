 * - [`/dashboard`](#section-dashboard)

 * onboarded yet or has not finished onboarding, they will be redirected there.

 * ### Redirect route
 *
 * If the user was redirected to onboarding or auth, it will append the original
 * route the user was meant to see as a URL query parameter, `route`. It is
 * up to the redirect route to handle going to the original route once the
 * action (auth or onboarding) is done.
