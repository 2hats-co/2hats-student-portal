# Temporary type definitions

Type definitions for JS packages without types in DefinitelyTyped go here.
Please use npm packages that already have types or are written in TypeScript so
we donâ€™t have to do this.

## Writing type definitions

Create a file with the name of the package (same as the npm package name).
